// Intial thoughts:
// I think this will be a monolithic application. It will act as a server
// or a client, depending on the command line arguments.
// Someone will create a server, and multiple clients can connect to it.
// The server will be able to send messages to all clients, and clients
// will be able to send messages to the server and to other clients.
